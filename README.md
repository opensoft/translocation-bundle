Symfony 2 Translocation Bundle
=================

No, it's not a typo. It's a melding of translation, locale, internationalization, and localization.
This package is meant to extend and enhance the capabilities of Symfony 2 Translation Service.

A few areas of the Symfony2 Translate Service that seems to be lacking are:

* The ability to parse smarty templates
* The ability to use browser-accepts locale
* Decent UI reporting for translation strings
* A flexible translation command

For more information, take a look @ the [documentation](http://translocation-bundle.t73.biz)
